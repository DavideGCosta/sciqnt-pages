    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "In the fast-paced world of financial news and behavioral finance, each piece of information contains both fundamental and non-fundamental elements. The challenge lies in sifting through the overwhelming noise and massive influx of data that surpass human processing capabilities. But what if we could identify patterns within this data? Better yet, what if we could use computers to do it for us? Today, we are fortunate to have access to open-source models that make text comprehensible to machines. This process, known as ‘Sentence Embeddings,’ has revolutionized AI and deep learning. By converting textual data into meaningful numerical representations, sentence embeddings empower us to discern market sentiment, spot emerging trends, and predict financial movements with unprecedented efficiency and accuracy."

    "## Introduction\n",
    "The first step in building a strategy that leans on financial news to analyze patterns and market sentiment is sourcing and ingesting those news items. Just like any data-driven analysis, the quality of your input data determines the quality of your output. Remember, garbage in, garbage out; no state-of-the-art model can compensate for poor data.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, what makes a good dataset of financial news?\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Comprehensive Coverage:** It should pull from a wide range of sources, including major financial news outlets and industry-specific publications. This ensures a broad perspective on market events and sentiments.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Timeliness:** Financial markets move quickly, so the dataset should be updated frequently to capture the latest news and developments. Real-time or near real-time data is ideal.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Relevance:** The news articles should be pertinent to the financial markets, covering topics like stock market updates, economic indicators, corporate earnings, mergers and acquisitions, regulatory changes, and geopolitical events.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Diversity of Perspectives:** Including news from various geographical regions and economic sectors can provide a more holistic view of the market. This helps in understanding global market dynamics and sector-specific trends.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Quality and Credibility:** The sources should be reputable and known for their accuracy and reliability. This reduces the risk of misinformation affecting analysis and investment decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Metadata:** Each news item should come with useful metadata, such as publication date, source, author, geographical region, and topic tags. This aids in filtering, sorting, and analyzing the data more effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Sentiment Analysis Ready:** The dataset should be in a format conducive to natural language processing and sentiment analysis. Clean, well-structured text data with minimal noise is ideal.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Historical Data:** Access to historical news data allows for trend analysis over time, which can be crucial for identifying long-term patterns and correlations.\n",
    "\n",
    "By ensuring these characteristics, a financial news dataset becomes a robust tool for analyzing market conditions and identifying investment opportunities."

    "\n",
    "Alternatively, or as a complement to the previous sources, you can dive into the world of semantic search by keywords in financial news. This method casts a wide net, scooping up news from virtually any source, offering an impressively comprehensive search. However, there’s a catch—it also dredges up a fair share of irrelevant news and content from potentially dubious providers. So, before you dive into analysis, you’ll need a solid spam filter to sift out the noise and ensure you’re not swimming in a sea of non-credible stuff."

    "\n",
    "Now that we’ve identified our sources and keywords, it’s time to pull the news data. There are several methods to do this, ranging from free to premium, but let’s focus on the budget-friendly options:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Financial News APIs:** Free tiers of services like Alpha Vantage, NewsAPI, and Finnhub provide real-time and historical financial news data. This method offers the simplest access but can be limited in scope and data availability.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Web Scraping:** Build your own web scrapers using tools like Beautiful Soup or Scrapy in Python to extract data from financial news websites. However, this requires adherence to each site’s scraping policies, and handling captchas and logins can make it quite challenging.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **RSS Feeds:** Some sources offer free RSS feeds you can subscribe to for pulling information. The downside is you’ll need to handle each source individually, and not all sources provide RSS feeds.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **News Aggregators:** Platforms like Google News and Feedly consolidate news from multiple sources in one place, standardizing the information. While they typically offer only news titles, summaries, and metadata, this is often sufficient for initial analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Google News also provides an RSS feed, simplifying the process of pulling financial news. For this reason, we’ll use it as our example."

    "The snippet can be split as follows:\n",
    "- `make_DTawareUCT`: Imagine you’ve got a bunch of datetime strings lounging around with no clue what timezone they belong to. That’s where this function steps in, takes these naive datetime strings, and whisks them into the UTC timezone.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `clean_description`: You know how news descriptions come plastered with HTML tags and clutter? Using BeautifulSoup, it scrapes off all those pesky tags and unwanted spaces, leaving behind just the clean, pure text. It’s like giving your news description a nice shower, ready for the spotlight in your analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `get_googleNewsRss`: Now, here’s the main event. This function crafts a search URL with all your secret ingredients—topics, subtopics, keywords, and timing. It then sends this URL out into the web and waits for the XML data to come back. Once it’s got the goods, it parses through the XML, picking out relevant bits like titles, links, descriptions, and sources. It even checks the publication date’s timezone and cleans up the description’s HTML mess. Each piece of news gets its own little data packet, and before you know it, you’ve got a DataFrame full of fresh, neatly organized news articles."

    "Now that we’ve meticulously gathered our financial news articles and compiled them into the df_AllNews DataFrame, it’s time to dive into the data and extract some meaningful insights. With a rich dataset at our disposal, we can move beyond merely collecting news to analyzing it for patterns, trends, and actionable intelligence. To achieve this, we’ll utilize the show_interesting_stats function, which will provide a comprehensive overview of our dataset. This function will dissect the DataFrame, revealing the number of articles, the diversity of sources, the time span of the news, and the most frequently mentioned keywords and topics. By examining these statistics, we can gain a clearer understanding of the current financial news landscape and uncover the dominant narratives shaping the market."
